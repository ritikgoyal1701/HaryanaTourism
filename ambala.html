    <h2>BADSHAHI BAGH GURUDWARA</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Badshahi Bagh Gurudwara lies near the district courts of Ambala city. It commemorates to the visit of Guru Gobind Singh, who stayed here while returning from Lakhnaur, where he had gone to meet his maternal parents. He stayed in the garden,
      under a cluster of trees. A tank has also been built near the Gurudwara Badshahi Bagh. Guru Gobind Singh ji, the tenth Guru, visited this place around 1670 during one of his excursions to Lakhnaur. While on a hunting trip one day on his horse,
      he came to a big garden just outside the city of Ambala. Then he was a small child of eight years, he had with him his white hawk as well. The garden belonged to Pir Amir Din, the custodian of the Muslim shrines of the city. He happened to be
      present in the garden at the same time. Pir Amir Din had with him a black hawk. On seeing Guruji's white hawk, the Pir got a liking to it and began thinking of how to posses the white hawk for himself.
      <br /><br />
      He threw a challenge to the Guru for a fight between the two hawks. But, Guruji realising the real intention of the Pir, refused and said that instead of the hawk, he would make sparrows fight the Pir's hawk. The Pir laughed and said that
      sparrows were food for his hawk, but Guruji repeated his words. With this, Guruji called upon two sparrows that were sitting on a tree to fight with the hawk. The sparrows fought so ferociously that the hawk was injured badly. It finally fell
      to its death about a kilometer away, near Labbu ka Talaab, the site of GurudwaraGobindpura. The Pir realised his folly and built a platform in honor of the Guru. It is here that Guru Gobind Singh uttered his famous words: "Chirion se main baaz
      larun, tabe Gobind Singh naam kahaun". (It is when I make sparrows fight hawks that I am called Gobind Singh)
