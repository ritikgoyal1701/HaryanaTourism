      <h2>KOTLA</h2>
      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        Kotla is a village coordinates Latitude 28.0137 North and Longitude 76.937668 East and located about 7 kms south of Nuh, the district headquarters of Nuh. It is a historic village and once the capital of Nuh during Mewati Yadubanshi ruler Bahadur Nahar Khan. This village is also important for its location in the Arawali foothills and scenic outlook. Historically, Kotila was the first capital of Mewat ruled by its own people popularly known as Khanzadas. The village Kotila is situated in a small valley, wholly surrounded by the hill, except where a small tunnel-like pass gives entrance to it. In front of this pass is the Kotila Lake, and when this is filled with water, the only road to the pass lies along a narrow strip of land between the lake and the hill. Cunningham describes the position of the Kotila that the site was probably chosen for security as it is protected on the east by the large lake named Dahar, which is from four to five miles in length and upwards of two miles in a breath.
