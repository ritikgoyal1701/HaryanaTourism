      Pirs or holy men in this region grew jealous of Guru Nanak Ji’s increasing number of followers. The Head of the Muslim group decided to take revenge by moving a wall on which he was sitting, towards Guru Nanak Ji. However, the wall stopped
      moving when the Pir reached the vicinity of Guru Nanak Ji. He admitted his mistake of trying to use his miraculous powers to defeat Guru Ji. He got down from the wall and went on foot to pay his respects to the Guru. The all-knowing Guru Nanak
      Ji, then, advised him to give up such useless practices and instead use his spiritual powers for the welfare of the people. Guru Harkrishan Sahib Ji, the Sixth Guru, is also said to have visited Karnal.
