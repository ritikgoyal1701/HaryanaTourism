    <h1>JHAJJAR</h1>
    <p>
      Jhajjar is one of the 21 districts of the state of Haryana. The district, with its headquarters in Jhajjar town, was carved out of Rohtak district on July 15, 1997. The town is believed to have been founded by Chhaju as Chhajunagar. The name was later changed to Jhajjar. The second story goes that the name has been derived from Jharnaghar, a natural fountain. A third version has it that it was named Jhajjar, a water vessel, because the surface drainage of the area for miles around runs into the town as into a sink.

        <h2>GURUKUL, JHAJJAR MUSEUM</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Gurukul Jhajjar Archeological Museum is a place of pride for the town. It is the biggest museum in Haryana. The committed and passionate effort of Swami Omanand Saraswati in collecting antiques from various parts of the country brought this museum into being in 1959. The huge museum has antique coins and beautiful variety of idols.
          <br /><br />
         The major attractions are idols of Panchwati’s deer statue (referring to Sita’s kidnapping), Lord Vishnu, and Lord Ganesha. Meticulously and tactfully made wooden chain with no joints and a unique 'flexible' stone are worth-seeing.

        <h2>BHINDAWAS BIRDS SANCTUARY</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Bhindawas Bird Sanctuary is located 15 km from Jhajjar town in Haryana and three hours drive from Delhi, the capital of India. It is spread over an area of 1074 acres. The primary attraction of the sanctuary is its magnificent lake which draws approximately 35,000 varieties of migratory water birds comprising more than 250 species from various regions of the world.
          <br /><br />
          Spread over an area of 440 acres, the lake is surrounded by a man-made 12 km embankment which was basically built to trap water that escaped from the Jawaharlal Lal Nehru canal through a tunnel whenever the lift system stopped functioning during the power failure. The sanctuary has acquired an ecological importance in view of the diminishing water level in the world renowned Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary in Rajasthan. It is a haven for birds here. The spectacular lake is a veritable feast to the eyes. It contains a number of tiny islands which serve as nesting place for the birds. It is not possible to ‘shoot’ the beauty of the vast expanse of water without exceptionally powerful lens.

        <h2>BUA WALA TALAB</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Bua Wala Talab in Jhajjar has a heart rending 375 years old story of true love behind its construction. According to the legend, one day Bua, the brave and vivacious daughter of Mustaffa Khan, a satrap of the Nawab of Jhajjar, rode her horse to a forest.
          <br /><br />
          Unluckily she was attacked by a tiger and screamed for help. Hearing her cries, Hassan, a poor but handsome wood cutter who was working close by rushed to the spot. He killed the tiger and brought her back in a grievously injured state.
          <br /><br />
          The grateful father of Bua offered a reward to the woodcutter, but was taken aback when he requested for the hand of his daughter in marriage. Mustaffa Khan grudgingly accepted his request but postponed the event for some time. One day he asked Hassan to join the Nawab’s army and go a battle field. The wood cutter obliged, but was killed in the battle.

        <h2>THE ANCIENT TEMPLE OF PANDVAS BHIMESHWARI GODDESS</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          There is a hint of mythology at Goddess Bhimeshwari Temple. According to a legend, the idol of the goddess was installed by Bhima, one of the Pandavas. Before Mahabharata battle, Bhima wanted to have blessings of Kuldevi. Yudhishthira and Bhima went to Hinglay Mountain (now in Pakistan) and prayed Kuldevi to move to the battle field and bless them with victory. The Kuldevi accepted the plea with the condition that Bhima will not drop her down on the way from the his lap and if he does so, she will go no further from that place.
          <br /><br />
While on way Bhima placed the idol of Goddess under the Beri tree and as per the condition, Kuldevi remained there. Unfortunately Bhima had to go to Kurukshetra battle only with blessings of Kuldevi. After 18 days of the war, a marvellous temple was built here.

        <h2>GROUP OF TOMBS AND MOSQUES</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
           A group of tombs and mosques are located in 'Bua Ka Talab' area. Chronologically almost all of them were built when Mughal emperors Akbar, Jahangir and Shahjahan reigned (1594-1626 AD). They present fine examples of an antedated Pathan style of architecture, and also resemble the style of Shargi monuments of Jaunpur. Homogeneity of grandiose architecture and planning indicate that it was a family graveyard probably of the local chiefs and nobles of repute.

        <h2>BERI MANDIR</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Beri Mandir is so called because it is situated in Beri town in district Jhajjar. It houses the idol of goddess Bhimeshwari Devi. According to scriptures Lord Krishna asked Bhim to bring their kuldevi, or family goddess, to the battlefield of Kurukshetra to seek her blessings for victory. Bhim, accordingly, visited mountain Kinglay, the abode of the goddess and requested her to accompany him to the battlefield. The goddess accepted his prayer with the proviso that he would carry her in his lap and not drop her on the way. As the great warrior was bringing her he experienced a strong urge to ease himself. He, therefore, placed the goddess under a beri tree. When he came back, the goddess refused to accompany him any longer because he had broken his word. She, therefore, stayed put at the spot and sent him back. When the battle of Mahabharat ended, Gandhari, the queen mother of Kauravs passed by the Beri tree and built a temple at the spot. This may probably be another reason why the temple is so named. An interesting feature of the temple is that married couples visit it to retie their nuptial knot in the presence of the goddess.
