  <h1>FATEHABAD</h1>
  <p>
    Fatehabad is a city in the Fatehabad district in Haryana, India. It is believed that Aryans first settled on the banks of the rivers Saraswati and Drishadvati and then gradually expanded their base to Hisar and Fatehabad. Fatehabad also finds
    mention in the Puranas which say that it was part of the Nanda Empire.
    <br /><br />
    The discovery of the Ashoka Pillars at Fatehabad also shows that it was part of the Maurayan Empire. Excavations carried out here by the Archaeological Survey of India have revealed interesting finds that throw light on ancient India’s culture
    and heritage. The modern town of Fatehabad was founded by Firuz Shah Tughlak in the 14th century. He named it Fatehabad after his son Fateh Khan.

    <h2>HUMAYUN MOSQUE</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Humayun Mosque, as the name suggests, was built by Mughal Emperor Humayun. He was, however, not a strong ruler like his father, Babur. He was defeated by Sher Shah Suri and while on his way back he halted at a place where Feroz Shah Tughlak had
      built a fort.
      <br /><br />
      Humayun offered Friday prayers at this place and thereafter a mosque was also built here as a tribute to him. The architecture of the mosque follows Mughal style and it was completed in three decades from 1529 to 1556.
      <br /><br />
      The mosque hosts a big screen built with Lakhauri bricks pointing to its west as a direction for holding prayers. There is also a mehrab, an arch, which shows the direction of Kaaba in Mecca, the holiest place of Muslims.
      <br /><br />
      Humayun mosque is a very popular Islamic shrine and the Muslims visit the place in large numbers on Fridays to offer their prayers. It is a huge monument and can host thousands of people at a time.

    <h2>KUNAL</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Kunal is known for a historic mound located on the banks of the dried Saraswati river in the Fatehabad region. It is one of the oldest archaeological sites in the Haryana state. Excavations conducted at Kunal reveal a wealth of information on
      Harappan and Pre-Harappan culture.
      <br /><br />
      The historians have discovered a host of remnants of those times including pottery items, triangular shaped terracotta cakes, scripts, silver coins, a crown, several royal items including gold and silver ornaments, jewellery made of
      semi-precious stones and many more interesting articles.
      <br /><br />
      Above all, the excavations at Kunal mound reveal a very significant evidence about the three phases of the evolution of the Pre-Harappan culture. It shows how the people first lived in pits and then they built houses with mud bricks and finally
      they moved on to using kiln-baked bricks to make square and rectangular residences.
      <br /><br />
      The historians have come to a definite conclusion that the Vedic culture and the Pre-Harappan culture, in essence, are the same. The discovery of the triangular terracotta cakes testifies to the belief in Rig Veda that they were a symbol of
      fertility. The location of Kunal on the now dried Saraswati also finds mention in the Rig Veda.

    <h2>BANAWALI</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      This site at village Banwali is on the dry bed of ancient river Sarasvati. The excavations have yielded three-fold culture sequence: Pre-Harappan (Early-Harappan), Harappan and Bara (post Harappan). This site was excavated by Dr. R.S.Bhist of
      Archaeological Survey of India.
      <br /><br />
      Pre-Harappan assemblage (2600-2400 BC) is repreesented by the existence of well-planned houses and a fortification wall made of moulded bricks. In the pottery of this period, pre-Harappan painted motifs tended to become simpler sparse and use
      of white pigment becomes less popular progressively. The finer variety of the pottery comparable with Harappan ceramic included dish-on-stand, basin, trough, jars and bowls. The other finds included beads of semi-precious stones, terracotta,
      steatite and bangles of clay, shell, faience and copper.
      <br /><br />
      Harappan Culture (2400-1900 BC) is marked by the presence of a well-planned fortified township laid in a radial pattern. The sophisticated red ware decorated with animal and floral designs comprises dish-on-stand, ‘S’-shaped jar, perforated
      jar, vase, cooking handis, beaker, basin and goblet etc. A terracotta plough model is important as it is a complete specimen found so far in Harappan Culture. Other remarkable finds are beads and bangles of semi-precious stones, terracotta and
      shell, chert blades, weights and sportsmen of ivory and bone, beads and foil in gold, terracotta animal figurines, inscribed steatite seals and terracotta seals, copper fish-hooks, charred barley grains etc.
      <br /><br />
      Bara Culture (1900-1700 BC) is represented by the most distinguished pottery, which is sturdy and heavy, made of fine clay, baked carefully and dressed with deep toned oily gloss. The smaller finds are very few and excluded all classical
      Harappan items except terracotta nodules and cakes.

    <h2>ANCIENT SITE OF BHIRRANA</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      This site is located on the northern outskirts of the village overlooking the now dried up bed of Vedic river Sarasvati. Archaeological excavations of 4.20 m thick deposit have revealed four fold cultural sequence. This site was excavated by Shri L.S.Rao of Archaeological Survey of India.
     <br /><br />
Period-IA : Hakra Wares Culture :- This period is characterised by well-plastered subterranean dwelling pits, which were cut into natural soil. Ceramic assemblage is represented by the Hakra wares of Cholistan region of Pakistan. All the representative antiquities of this phase found at other sites, including beads of semiprecious stones, terracotta object, copper bangles, bone points and chert blades were also found from here.
<br /><br />
Period-IB : Early Harappan :- The entire site was occupied during this period. The houses were built of mud bricks in the ratio of 1:2:3. Pottery of this period showed all the six fabrics found at Kalibanga-I. Antiquities, of copper, terracotta, semiprecious stone and bone objects apart from a seal of quarter-foil shape made of shell, are similar and comparable with find of other such settlements.
<br /><br />
Period-IIA : Early mature Harappan :- This period is marked by transformation in the city lay-out. The fortification wall around the entire settlement was made out of mud bricks. Pottery assemblage included early Harappan and early mature Harappan ceramics.
<br /><br />
Period-IIB : Mature Harappan :- The final occupation of the site is represented by typical Harappan steatite seals, antiquities and pottery recovered from contemporary Harappan sites.
