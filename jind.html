    <p>
      Jind is a city which is known as the heart of Haryana. It is one of the oldest districts of Haryana and holds historical and mythological importance. It is believed that here a Jayanti Devi Temple was built in honour of Jayanti Devi (The Goddess of Victory) by Pandavas. Slowly the town was developed around the temple hence the name Jaitapuri turned Jind. Another legend is that the Sikh Maharaja Ranjeet Singh named this city after on the name of his youngest queen "Maharani Jind kaur" as this city was under the erstwhile Patiala Riyasat.
      <br /><br />
       The excavations of archaeology indicate that this city was ruined for five times but every time it prospered again with full spirit. The archaeological findings also link to the presence of pre-Harappan era at this place. It is said that Lord Rama passed from this city at the time of Sita’s 'swayamwara' to break the Shiva’s bow.
       <br /><br />
       Interestingly, Jind was also one of the first Sikh kingdoms. Raja Gajpat Singh, a great grandson of Phul, who founded the Phulkian Misl, established an independent Sikh kingdom by conquering a large tract of country which included the territory occupied by the present district of Jind from the Afghan invader and governor Zain Khan in 1763 and made Jind city, the capital of the state in 1776. He made a fort here in 1775.

        <h2>JAYANTI DEVI TEMPLE</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Jayanti Devi Temple was built some 550 years back in reverence to the wishes of the daughter of the ruler of Kangra, in Himachal Pradesh, who was married to one of the sons of the ruler of Hathnaur, located in the north of Chandigarh. The princess was an ardent devotee of Jayanti Devi, the goddess of their clan.
          <br /><br />
          She was worried that she would be deprived of the worship of the goddess after her marriage in the absence of the temple. She, therefore, prayed hard to the goddess for help.
          <br /><br />
          It is said that the doli (palanquin) carrying her became so heavy that its bearers could not move further. Seeing this predicament, a small idol of the goddess was placed inside the doli and the problem was resolved.
          <br /><br />
          The ruler of Hathnaur, therefore, built a temple dedicated to Goddess Jayanti Devi at a hillock in the Shivalik ranges, 15 kilometres from Chandigarh. The village Jayanti Majri and Jayanti Archeological Museum located at the foot of the hill and a seasonal stream, Jayanti Rao, flowing close by owe their names to the temple which can be reached after climbing a hundred steps.

        <h2>EKAHAMSA</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          The word “hamsa” in the title refers to the migratory bird “swan” or “goose”, which according to Hindu-Buddhist views is the vehicle or the ride of Goddess Saraswati. The reason why the goddess chose this bird is that it can fly non-stop for whopping 7,000 miles over great heights. The swan is a bar-headed bird that resides in Mansarovar Lake in Tibet and flies over thousands of miles to migrate to Indian habitats during winter. According to Upanishads, the swan eats only pearls and can segregate milk from water if both are mixed together. Moreover, it possesses the holy knowledge of the Brahma. The sacred land of Jind has deep roots in mythology. This explains the existence of Ekahamsa Temple in the village of Ikkas about five miles from Jind. It can be accessed through Jind-Hansi road. The shrine is also mentioned in epics which relate to Lord Krishna. The temple also has a painting portraying how the lord showers his love on one and all.

        <h2>DHAMTAN SAHIB GURUDWARA</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          The word “sahib” is normally used with gurudwaras, the temples of the Sikhs. But, the reason why it has been used with a village is because Dhamtan is a religious and historical place. The name Dhamtan is also considered a corruption of the word “dharamsthan” meaning “religious place”.
          <br /><br />
          Village Dhamtan Sahib is primarily a Jat stronghold and is situated 17 kilometres from Narwana Tehsil in Jind district. The village is home to an ancient Shiva temple and an ashram of Rishi Valmiki, the creator of the epic Ramayan. It is also believed that Lord Ram conducted the Ashwamedha Yagna at this place.
          <br /><br />
          Guru Teg Bahadur, the ninth guru of the Sikhs, is also believed to have stayed here on his journey to Delhi. A fort like gurudwara in a 500 acre area gifted by the locals to the Guru was built to commemorate the visit of the guru. There is also another gurudwara in the village named Manji Sahib.

        <h2>BHUTESHWAR TEMPLE</h2>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Bhuteshwar Temple is called so because it is dedicated to Lord Shiva who is also called Bhootnath, the lord of the bhoots, ghosts or spirits. This explains why almost all the crematoria in North India are adorned with huge idols of Lord Shiva. When a person dies and he is cremated, what is left is his spirit.
          <br /><br />
          The temple is situated on Gohana road. It was built by Raja Raghbir Singh, the ruler of Jind. It is built on the pattern of the Golden Temple of Amritsar since it is surrounded by a huge water tank or talaab. Therefore, it is also called Rani Talaab.
          <br /><br />
          One reason for building the tank was for the queen to take a bath in it. The king, therefore, built a tunnel connecting the tank with the palace so that Her Majesty could access it without being exposed to public view. The remnants of the tunnel are still visible. The temple houses the idols of several other gods and goddesses. It is also known as the pool of the royal family of the state of Jind.
