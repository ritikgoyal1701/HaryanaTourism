    Hisar, the administrative headquarters of Hisar district in the state of Haryana, is located 164 km to the west of New Delhi. It has been identified as a counter-magnet city for the National Capital Region to attract migrants and develop as an
    alternative centre of growth to Delhi. Hisar is well known for its steel industry and is therefore also known as "The City of Steel".
    <br /><br />
    Hisar was founded in 1354 AD, by Firoz Shah Tughlaq as Hisar-e-Firoza. He reigned over the Sultanate of Delhi from 1351 to 1388 and was responsible for bringing the waters of the Yamuna river to the city via a canal. Two rivers, Ghaggar and
    Drishadvati once blessed the city but they have now changed their course. Over the years, Hisar witnessed the rule of several major powers including the Mauryans in the 3rd century BC, the Tughlaqs in the 14th century, the Mughals in the 16th
    century and the British in the 19th century. Post-independence, it became a part of Punjab. However, when Punjab was divided in 1966, it became a part of Haryana.

      area. A progressive distortion of the word 'George' to Jahaj over a period of time brought a new name to the place.
