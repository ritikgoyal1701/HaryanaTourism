    <h2>Tomb of Bu-Ali Shah Kalandar</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Standing deftly for seven hundred years, this tomb is also known as Dargah of Shah Kalandar Khizar Khan, the son of Allau-din Khilji. Bu-Ali-Shah Kalandar was a saint born in 1190 A.D.
      <br><br>
      Enclosed at Qalandar chowk, this is one tomb, whose architecture matches the likes of Ajmer Dargah, Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah at Delhi among others, but is largely unexplored as of now. This mausoleum, constructed in the Mughal era, by the army
      general of Emperor Jahangir, Mahabat Khan, was made in the memory of the famous Sufi saint of the Chishti order, Hazrat Shareefuddin Bu Ali Shah Qalandar, or Bu Ali Shah Qalandar for common reference. He completed his studies at an early age
      and used to teach near the famous Qutb Minar of 20 years. A popular saint of the Delhi Sultanate, he was said to be the spiritual disciple of the famous saint, Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki himself. This tomb is thronged annually in the famous
      festival of Urs by devotees of all classes and religions. This is one destination which should be earmarked in your itinerary for Panipat.

    <h2>Kala Amb</h2>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Located on the outskirts of Panipat, about 8 kilometres away from it; the Kala Amb is a historical site of great importance. This majestic ground witnessed the third battle of Panipat between the Maratha warriors and the Afghan army, and thus
      holds immense significance in the history of India. If legends are to be believed, the war ground, as well as the other plantations in the vicinity, turned black due to the uncontrolled bloodshed that took place in the war. The mango tree
      situated in the centre of the ground started to bear back fruits, and gave the land the name of 'Kala Amb'.
      <br><br>
      Ironically enough, people now visit the area to enjoy some quiet moments in the peaceful surroundings of the park. There is an altogether different and inexplicable kind of aura in the park and its vicinity, which somehow pacifies and composes
      all its visitors. The site is currently being developed and beautified by society in Panipat, with the Governor of Haryana as its President. The Ror Maratha community also organises an annual event at this site to honour the valiant soldiers
      who passed away, and this programme is a must attend.
